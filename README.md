Bark- A Virtual Assistant
A BARK is the software that can perform task and provide different services to the individual as per the individualâ€™s dictated commands. This is done through a synchronous process involving recognition of speech patterns and then, responding to it. Through these assistants a user can automate tasks like playing videos, opening web browsers, accessing camera, calendar and weather information, etc.. As the technology is developing day by day people are becoming more dependent on it, one of the mostly used platform is computer. We all want to make the use of these computers more comfortable, traditional way to give a command to the computer is through keyboard but a more convenient way is to input the command through voice and also execute the desired instructions and give output either in the form of voice or any other means.
